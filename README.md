## Introduction

Fluxim aims to bring about a paradigm shift in the approach towards wealth distribution and utilization in the world of cryptocurrencies. By harnessing the principles of decentralization, transparency, and trust inherent in blockchain technology, Fluxim seeks to empower individuals with a strong track record of altruism, responsible spending, and contributions to humanity. These individuals, known as Fluxim Guardians, will distribute Fluxim to others, forming the foundation of a more equitable and productive economic system.

## Fluxim Distribution

Fluxim's distribution system is similar to a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme, but with a key difference: the primary goal isn't profit but the benefit of humanity as a whole. The process begins with Fluxim Guardians, who are selected based on their contributions to society and their responsible financial practices. 

The Guardians are given a certain amount of Fluxim, which they must distribute to other trustworthy individuals within a specified time frame. This tiered distribution process continues, propagating downwards with each recipient becoming a distributor themselves. Any undistributed Fluxim within the stipulated timeframe will be deleted from the ledger, ensuring active distribution.

## Fluxim Dual-Coin System

Fluxim introduces a novel dual-coin system comprising the Base Fluxim (B-Fluxim) and Extra Fluxim (E-Fluxim). 

### Base Fluxim

B-Fluxim serves as the core unit of the currency and consists of a combination of wrapped Bitcoin and native B-Fluxim coins. B-Fluxim coins are generated at a fixed rate and form the basis of the E-Fluxim coins.

### Extra Fluxim

E-Fluxim coins are generated from the B-Fluxim coins, creating a surplus over the base amount. The E-Fluxim is designed to promote spending; these coins will be deleted from the ledger if not spent within a set timeframe. However, once spent, E-Fluxim converts into B-Fluxim, thus perpetuating economic activity.

## Economic Stimulation

The inherent design of Fluxim compels users to spend their surplus (E-Fluxim) before it gets deleted, in contrast to traditional cryptocurrencies where holding is incentivized due to appreciation. This unique mechanism not only discourages hoarding but also stimulates economic activity as users actively seek to utilize their E-Fluxim.

## Transferability

The base amount (B-Fluxim) can be transferred between individuals, allowing for typical economic transactions. After the initial distribution phase, users can acquire more B-Fluxim to generate more E-Fluxim, thus creating a dynamic, self-sustaining economy.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

Fluxim leverages the security of Bitcoin's blockchain and the versatility of Ethereum's smart contract functionality. The
dual-blockchain system ensures a robust and secure operation while allowing complex transactions and operations necessary for Fluxim's unique features.

## Conclusion

Fluxim presents a novel approach to address the wealth distribution and utilization issues often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies. By incentivizing spending and leveraging a unique distribution mechanism, Fluxim hopes to create a more equitable and economically active environment in the cryptocurrency space.

# The Fluxim Global Adoption Plan

## 1. Introduction

The Fluxim Global Adoption Plan is an ambitious roadmap to bring Fluxim to every individual on the planet, leveraging the power and influence of Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. This plan outlines a hypothetical scenario where Satoshi goes public and plays a key role in the initial distribution of Fluxim, setting the stage for its global proliferation.

## 2. Satoshi's Public Reveal and Pledge to Fluxim

Satoshi Nakamoto, after years of anonymity, makes a public appearance announcing support for the Fluxim project. In a historic move, Satoshi pledges to convert a significant portion of his Bitcoin holdings into Fluxim Base (B-Fluxim), sparking global interest and drawing significant attention to the project.

## 3. Satoshi as the First Fluxim Guardian

With his immense influence and credibility, Satoshi becomes the first Fluxim Guardian. He leverages his newly converted B-Fluxim holdings to generate Extra Fluxim (E-Fluxim) which is set to be distributed to select individuals who have demonstrated their commitment to humanity and responsible financial habits.

## 4. Selection of Subsequent Fluxim Guardians

The individuals chosen by Satoshi, known as the Satoshi Circle, become the next set of Fluxim Guardians. They are entrusted with the responsibility of further distributing the Fluxim they receive, furthering the MLM-like structure.

## 5. The Distribution Wave

The Satoshi Circle, armed with their Fluxim, initiates the first wave of distribution, selecting their respective circles of recipients who in turn become Fluxim Guardians. Each Guardian has a set timeframe to distribute their E-Fluxim or face its deletion. This mechanism ensures that the distribution wave keeps expanding, eventually reaching everyone on the planet.

## 6. Establishing Economic Activity

As Fluxim reaches more people, it begins to be used for transactions. The time-sensitive nature of E-Fluxim coins encourages spending, stimulating economic activity. At the same time, users begin to accumulate B-Fluxim coins, which can generate more E-Fluxim coins, creating a self-sustaining economic cycle.

## 7. Global Proliferation

Over time, Fluxim, with its dual-coin system and incentivized spending, becomes a widely accepted and used form of currency. With every individual on the planet now having access to Fluxim, the project achieves its ultimate goal of global distribution and economic stimulation.

## 8. Conclusion

The Fluxim Global Adoption Plan leverages the influence of a figure like Satoshi Nakamoto to kickstart the proliferation of Fluxim, eventually reaching every individual on the planet. This strategy not only ensures a wide distribution of Fluxim but also fosters a more equitable and active economic system.

# Fluxim Governance Structure

Fluxim introduces a democratic governance model that empowers its users to influence the cryptocurrency's monetary policies. In this structure, Base Fluxim (B-Fluxim) holders have voting rights proportional to their holdings. If a user fails to vote, their voting power transfers upwards in the MLM chain, ensuring that every vote counts. This README outlines the proposed governance structure and built-in mechanisms to stabilize business cycles.

## 1. Voting Power

Each holder of B-Fluxim coins possesses voting rights in Fluxim's governance. The voting power is proportionate to the number of B-Fluxim coins held by an individual. This structure ensures that individuals who have a significant stake in the Fluxim economy can influence its direction.

## 2. Transfer of Voting Power

In the event a B-Fluxim holder fails to exercise their voting right, their power is not wasted. Instead, it transfers up the MLM chain to the individual who distributed the coins to them. This mechanism ensures that every vote counts, and decisions are made with maximum community input.

## 3. Monetary Policy

The governance structure allows for the democratic establishment of Fluxim's monetary policies. B-Fluxim holders can vote on critical decisions, such as changes to the generation rate of Extra Fluxim (E-Fluxim), adjustment of the time limit for E-Fluxim spending, and alterations to the MLM distribution structure.

## 4. Stabilizing Business Cycles

Fluxim's ledger incorporates mechanisms inspired by measures taken by the Federal Reserve and other financial institutions to stabilize business cycles in traditional fiat economies. 

These could include:

### 4.1 Counter-Cyclical Measures

During boom cycles, B-Fluxim holders can vote to decrease the generation rate of E-Fluxim to prevent inflation. Conversely, in downturns, they could vote to increase the generation rate to stimulate spending and economic activity.

### 4.2 Monetary Interventions

The governance structure allows for interventions such as the strategic deletion or creation of E-Fluxim in response to economic indicators. These measures aim to control inflation or deflation and maintain the stability of the Fluxim economy.

## 5. Conclusion

Fluxim's proposed governance structure empowers its users, allowing them to actively participate in shaping the cryptocurrency's economic policies. By combining democratic decision-making with built-in stabilization mechanisms, Fluxim aims to create a robust and resilient economic system.
